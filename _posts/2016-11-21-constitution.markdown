We are Daemo, an open-source crowdsourcing platform governed by its workers and requesters. The Daemo constitution is amended by this community to reflect their evolving needs.

Daemo aims to offer an excellent experience for all its members: high quality work for requesters and fair working conditions for workers.  To achieve this, governance on Daemo is structured to enable workers and requesters to discuss ideas and develop amendments. A team focused on the technical implementation of Daemo ensures that new constitutional amendments are built and work to improve platform features and performance. This independence facilitates keeping Daemo cutting edge while also allowing it to respond to the evolving needs of its users.

With this constitution, we describe community standards for platform participation and a mechanism for those standards to be updated through crowd governance.

# Membership

### Participation in Daemo
Participation in Daemo and its governance is not restricted. Anyone with a Daemo account, which is free for all, can participate.

User profiles on Daemo display no personally identifiable information about members by default. The profile will identify members by their role(s) in the community and their degree of activity.
Members are required to adhere to community standards.

### Daemo community
The Daemo community is the active population of members that work or create projects on Daemo. It does not include the people who develop the platform.

Members of the community are categorized as workers or requesters. Community members who spend at least 40% of their time on Daemo performing tasks will be considered Workers for voting. Community members who spend at least 40% of their time on Daemo requesting tasks will be considered Requesters for voting. Members active in both capacities will be able to choose the body from which their vote will be counted.

Members who spend less than 5 days a month working or requesting on Daemo are considered inactive. Inactive members’ votes are not counted while they remain inactive.

### Daemo platform team
The Daemo platform team implements and maintains Daemo. This includes but is not limited to platform development, financial management, and  ongoing research. The Daemo platform acts as an independent group whose activities must follow the constitution but operates externally to the community. For example, the platform does not participate in most of the voting.

All platform team activities are made public. Because the platform occasionally engages in long term research, some ongoing studies will not be disclosed until after their completion. All research conducted by the platform will comply with ethical research guidance from the Institutional Research Board (IRB).

### Resolution jury
A resolution jury is called when there are conflicts in interpreting this constitution between the different parties of the community or the platform.

The Resolution jury is made up of 2 participants from each of the worker community, the requester community and the platform team. When a resolution jury is needed, a new one is selected at random from the active members of each stakeholder group. Selected members may abstain from taking part and a replacement will be found through the same process. Members may not be on the jury more than once within 60 days, unless all other viable members of their stakeholder group have already been part of the jury.  As much as possible, jury members will be vetted to reduce conflicts of interest with the issue being discussed.

Resolution jury members receive a badge denoting their participation which they may choose to show publicly. Members will also be compensated for their time at the standard rate of $10 per hour.

# Governance
Daemo governance is based on an amendable constitution. Constitutional amendments allow the community to make specific needs and interests explicit, such that the platform team can interpret those needs and refine Daemo.

Anyone can suggest an idea to modify Daemo. If the idea attracts significant interest in the community, it can be developed into a proposed constitutional amendment and the community will vote to decide if it will be put into effect or not. If successful, the platform will then be tasked with executing any changes outlined in the amendment.

Voting on Daemo has been designed to incorporate the interests of the workers, requesters and the platform to balance their power and lead to a healthy, sustainable marketplace.

### Introducing and selecting ideas
Ideas are suggested in an online list visible to everyone in the community. The list allows others to comment and upvote ideas they like. Anyone with a Daemo forum account is able to provide and iterate upon ideas. Ideas that reach a threshold of popularity will move onto idea iteration. Popularity is visible on the original post of an idea thread based on the individual votes.

An idea reaches the popularity threshold when it receives upvotes from at least 10% of the members on Daemo.

All ideas will be accepted but are subject to the community standards.

#### Idea iteration
Ideas may be developed through comments and edits, or resubmitted as new ideas that encompass different perspectives.. The idea can be updated by the original author as it evolves through discussion.

#### Idea selection
Ideas that have received upvotes from at least 10% of the active  community members will progress to the next step, to be developed as amendments.

### Developing amendments
Amendments are developed by interested parties. These will often be the original idea from the author and key community members they recruit, to help them. Once they are content with the refinement of the amendment, it will be made available to the community to review. At this time, comments may be provided and critical feasibility will be evaluated. The authors will then be able to make adjustments based on these comments and submit the amendment for a final vote.

Amendments deemed infeasible will not be submitted for a final vote until they have been revised and assessed as feasible by the platform team. The platform team will provide a summary of the reasoning for their stance and support the amendment writing team as needed to ensure that a feasible option is developed.

Submitting an amendment for final voting involves compiling the changes in a pre-formatted file and submitting it as a ‘pull request’ to the constitution’s github repository. A post on the forum outlining the amendment, linking to the pull request, and offering a voting context will be released.

#### Removing amendments
Amendments that are considered unfavorable can be removed through the same amendment process.

### Voting
Voting to accept amendments is conducted within the active community (active workers and requesters only). A majority of both the voting workers and voting requesters is required for an amendment to be accepted.

A vote for an amendment remains open for 2 weeks. After that time, if the amendment has not yet been accepted, it will be rejected. Rejected amendments may be resubmitted as new ideas in the future.

### Conflicts and resolution
The platform is tasked with implementing amendments. When the platform team and the community don’t agree with how an amendment is being interpreted, a resolution jury will be evoked to deliberate on the appropriate interpretation. This jury has the power to decide and document the interpretation of the constitution with regard to a specific conflict.

Conflicts start as ideas that are tagged ‘interpretation conflict’. Interpretation conflicts will require popularity in the same way any other idea would, but are treated as conflicts, not amendments, when they reach popularity. At that point a new resolution jury will automatically be formed and assigned the issue.

The jury will resolve the conflict through a discussion process in which each stakeholder group presents their perspectives and comes to understand others’ perspectives. The discussion is initially private to avoid public meddling with the jury’s decision. At the end of this process, they will develop a way of resolving the issue that will involve delivering a proposed adjustment to the constitution based on their findings. This will then be made public along with the entire discussion that lead to the resolution, and the change will be voted on as though it were an amendment undergoing voting.

# Community standards

### Positive community
Daemo thrives on positive and fruitful relationships between its members. To this end, it is very important for each member of Daemo to work hard to uphold the goal of maintaining a positive community for everyone. In practice, this means Daemo will constantly strive to have no biases, implicit or explicit, and the Daemo members will be held to this standard too.

In general, membership management and community standards follow those outlined by the discourse community.

### Flagging
Daemo allows any member’s activity to be flagged if it needs to be brought to the community’s attention in an anonymous way. Flagging occurs using a flag icon that appears near most instances of activity.

Posts on the forum can be flagged for a range of reasons including
1. Inaccurate representation of information
1. Offensive and do not adhere to community standards
1. Does not support Daemo constitution and its inherent goals

Tasks posted by requesters can also be flagged if they include error, offensive material without suitable warnings, or if they ask workers to perform work that is unreasonably priced for the kind and amount of work. When tasks are flagged, the requester will receive a notification. If the task is flagged enough times, it will be removed from the task list of other workers until it is repaired.

### Evidence based governance
All references regarding changes to the constitution or evidence upon which decisions are made will be linked to the source from where it came from. Evidence, which has no source, will not be considered for any decision.  Hearsay is immediately dismissed.
